## Round up my personal experience

I get to work with two of the aforementioned ERP systems at work. When attempting to combine an e-commerce website and an API SaaS platform, the experience differs from task to task.

One of the biggest obstacles in connecting an e-commerce website with an ERP system is ensuring data quality and consistency across the two platforms. This necessitates creating a strong synchronization procedure between the e-commerce website and the ERP system, which calls for data transformation and data mapping. Additionally, the integration method needs to be designed to guarantee error-free data transmission from the e-commerce website to the ERP system.

There are additional difficulties when combining an ERP system with an API SaaS platform. Both systems must be able to transmit data accurately and securely for this integration to work. Additionally, an ERP system and an API SaaS platform generally interchange a substantial amount of data, which the API must be able to handle. The API must also be capable of handling any adjustments required to speed up the integration process.

Overall, careful planning and thought are needed to guarantee that data security and accuracy are maintained during the connection process between an e-commerce website and an ERP system or an API SaaS platform. To design a successful integration process, it is critical to comprehend the needs of both systems.
