          <Tool title="14” MacBook Pro, M3 Max, 128GB RAM (2023)">
            I am using an overkilled MacBook Pro and the performance is off the
            chart. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a single time, even under
            the incredibly heavy loads I put it through running local LLMs.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Apple Pro Display XDR (Nano-Texture Glass)">
            The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and
            bigger than 27”. When you’re getting old, every pixel you can get
            counts.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Keychron S1 Pro (Brown Switch)">
            This is an out of production keyboard and I have been buying them
            extras to keep for future. I have a lot of mechanical board. This is
            closest to heart"
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Logitech MX Master 3">
            Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with
            special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special
            powers.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Herman Miller Aeron Chair">
            If I’m going to slouch in the worst ergonomic position imaginable
            all day, I might as well do it in an expensive chair.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
          <Tool title="Cursor">
            The latest and greatest productivity IDE. All the nay-sayers can
            cringe now but for someone like me that code for fun. This is a no
            brainer.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="iTerm2">
            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="TablePlus">
            Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
            building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
            over the years.
          </Tool>
        </ToolsSection>
        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.

        <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
          <Tool title="Alfred">
            It’s not the newest kid on the block but it’s still the fastest. The
            Sublime Text of the application launcher world.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Notion">
            Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
            organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with Notion,
            it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff discoverable by
            topic even though all of my writing happens in the daily note.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="TidyCal">
            Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar and
            making sure I still have lots of time for deep work during the week.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Focus">
            Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just do
            the work and get some momentum going.
